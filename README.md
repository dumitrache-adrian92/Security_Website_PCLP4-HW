A beautiful website made for a fake cybersecurity company with a backend  
written in D using the vibe.d framework and MongoDB that supports creating accounts, adding files and adding URLS (to "scan" them for viruses).
  
See it in its full glory by running:  
```bash  
make start  
```  
  
and visiting 
```web link
localhost:8080/  
```  
Note: the frontend is only partially finished, the backend is complete for the  
most part
